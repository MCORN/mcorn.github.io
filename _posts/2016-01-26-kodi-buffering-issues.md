This is an attempt at resolving buffering issues that have started to occur more and more frequently, possibly not helped by rather heavy usage. I followed the Maintenance Tool Add-on and deleted cache and package files as per instructions [here](http://www.kodifixes.com/how-to-fix-kodi-buffering-issues-the-cause-and-solution/).
I will test and see if this reolves the issues, be it temporarily, or not.
