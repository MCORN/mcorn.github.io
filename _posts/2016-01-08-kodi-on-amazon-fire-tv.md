I bought an Amazon Fire TV in the New Year sales for the only purpose to install Kodi on it and it turned out to be the easiest thing ever... Just follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/sphinx02/FireStarter/wiki/Install-FireStarter-and-Kodi-(only-FireTV-needed)) and you are good to go in the next 5 minutes!

Next, get my medias in order to they are indexed properly by Kodi - see [here](http://kodi.wiki/view/Set_content_and_scan) for the basis.

Paradoxically, I did spend more time figuring out what was out there in terms of parental controls. My library is a mix of adult and kids movies in separate folders and while I am OK with the kids using the Fire TV, I don't want them watching what they shouldn't. The answer is [PinSentry](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on:PinSentry), which allows you to set a PIN when you press play based on the folder the movie is in. Works like a charm too. It also allows to do it based on ratings but I haven't tried that option.
