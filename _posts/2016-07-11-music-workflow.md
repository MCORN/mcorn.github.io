title: Music Workflow

Scenario: I have 3 rather large folders of digital music, neither organized in a folder structure, nor with correct metadata

## Cleaning up with beets
URL: [http://beets.io/](http://beets.io/)

## Making my music available
Use Cases:
* Mopidy: Playing music on a central machine from a web interface
* Madsonic: Streaming music from server to web interface

### Mopidy
URL: [https://www.mopidy.com/](https://www.mopidy.com/)
Description: Free music management tool that allows you amongst other things to control and play music *on the server* from a web interface.
Solid, good looking, quick and easy to install but I was looking for music streaming as opposed to play on the server.

### Madsonic
URL: [http://beta.madsonic.org/pages/index.jsp](http://beta.madsonic.org/pages/index.jsp)
Description: Free (Premium license available) fork of Subsonic, java-based self-hosted music management tool allowing amongst other things to play music from its web interface, theming (checkout [https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/rolleshark](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/rolleshark)) as well as a lightweight music player (so as not to scare away the less technical minded members of the household, checkout [https://github.com/tsquillario/Jamstash](https://github.com/tsquillario/Jamstash))
On the plus side, it is just dead easy to install, see [http://beta.madsonic.org/pages/installation.jsp](http://beta.madsonic.org/pages/installation.jsp).
Couple of things, JamStash doesn't support Internet Radios (like Madsonic itself does), and I have found a couple of funnies along the way (it is beta release so to be expected) that I am having a look into. 

TBC...
