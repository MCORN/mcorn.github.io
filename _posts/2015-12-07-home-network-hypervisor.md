After a while (it took a while, I am definitely getting old!), I remembered the biggest problem with VMWare ESXi. The free version doesn't allow you to administer the machine via the web interface, you need the VMWare client which has only a Windows version available.
So that's VMWare out, I will go down the route of VirtualBox and phpVirtualBox.
[Here](http://www.unixmen.com/install-oracle-virtualbox-and-manage-it-using-phpvirtualbox-on-ubuntu-15-10-headless-server/) is a HowTo to do exactely that.
