I tried motion on its own and the configuration of it rather scary... So more googling and came across [MotionEye](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye).

Extremely well documented [Ubuntu Installation Instructions](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye/wiki/Install-On-Ubuntu), easy to install and fully featured, once you don't forget to run the following line with sudo `pip install motioneye` (otherwise it will install, will start manually but the service will not...).

Makes adding cameras a doddle (once you get pass the guesswork of figuring out which USB ports on the computer are providing enough power for the USB Video Adapter I use to connect my CCTV cameras). Just plug in the webcams, add from the UI and it just works!

Code sample is even provided for a sample nginx configuration to put in front of the default UI.
