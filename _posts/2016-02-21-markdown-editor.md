I have until been using [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) to edit the markdown files making up this blog and it is working out OK. I am currently trying out a dedicated markdown editor called [Abricotine](http://abricotine.brrd.fr/) because it would be nice to be able to separate my code files from my blog posts (and what would be easier to separate them than to have separate editors for both). Also the online preview built into Apricotine is a nice feature, although it doesn't properly handle the title/updated section at the start of posts.
