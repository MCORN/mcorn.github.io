On my kids tablets (Android), I use [PerfectViewer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rookiestudio.perfectviewer&hl=en). Very small, allows to zoom in and out, can open files on the LAN (handy when there is a NAS server around and not much space on the tablet itself) and supports a huge range of files (CBR, CBZ, CBT of course but also plain PDFs using the PerfectViewer PDF extension).

On my own tablet (Windows 8.1), I use [Cover](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/cover-comic-reader/9wzdncrfj9w7). There is a small fee to be able to add the whole library but well worth it for the slick experience!
