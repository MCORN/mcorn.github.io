# Cheat
[Cheat](https://github.com/chrisallenlane/cheat) allows you to look up offline from the terminal the syntax for all those pesky terminal commands one uses only once in a while and forget all about in-between every time! My own nemesis is rsync...

# Storm SSH

[Storm SSH](https://github.com/emre/storm/blob/master/README.md) is a very handy command line tool to manage SSH connections. It allows you to pre-define a connection with all the relevant details and give it an alias which you can then call directly in your regular SSH command.
