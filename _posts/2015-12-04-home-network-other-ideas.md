Far from being fleshed out but here is a starting point.

1- VPN
[OpenVPN](http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html)
[FrootVPN](https://www.frootvpn.com)
[SSShuttle](https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle)

Note: I don't actually need to do any of those since DD-WRT actually has VPN functionality built-in. See [here](http://www.howtogeek.com/51772/how-to-setup-a-vpn-server-using-a-dd-wrt-router/) for reference.

Note 2: To set up a VPN connection on Ubuntu to the above, you need to enable Point-To-Point Encryption (MPPE) under Advanced Settings.
